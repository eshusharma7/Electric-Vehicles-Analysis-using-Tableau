This project provides a comprehensive analysis of Electric Vehicle (EV) data in the US, built using Tableau.
The dashboard allows stakeholders to:
1. Track EV adoption trends over time (by model year).
2. Analyze geographic distribution of EVs across states.
3. Compare manufacturers and their top-selling models.
4. Understand consumer adoption of BEVs vs PHEVs.
5. Explore CAFV (Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle) eligibility for incentive programs.
   
The interactive dashboard includes filters for:
1. EV Type (BEV, PHEV, All)
2. State(s)
3. Vehicle Model

This enables dynamic exploration of EV adoption patterns across demographics and geographies.

🔹KPI Requirements
1. Total Vehicles → 150,437
2. Average Electric Range → 67.86 miles
3. Total BEV Vehicles → 116,766 (77.62% of total)
4. Total PHEV Vehicles → 33,671 (22.38% of total)

🔹 Plots & Charts Used
1. Line/Area Chart → Total Vehicles by Model Year (2010–2024 trend).
2. Map Chart → Total Vehicles by State (geographic distribution).
3. Bar Chart → Top 10 Total Vehicles by Make (Tesla, Nissan, Chevrolet, etc.).
4. Donut Chart → Total Vehicles by CAFV Eligibility (Eligible, Not Eligible, Unknown).

Table with Bar Indicators → Total Vehicles by Model (Top models like Tesla Model Y, Model 3, Nissan Leaf).

KPI Cards → Highlight total numbers and averages at the top.
